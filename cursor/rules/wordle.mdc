# UI Styling Rules

1. Use **Next.js** as the frontend framework.
2. Use **shadcn/ui** for all UI components and styling.
3. Use **Tailwind CSS** via shadcn for consistent spacing, layout, and color theming.
4. Apply responsive design — must work on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
5. Enable **dark mode** support via Tailwind’s dark variant.
6. Icon I prefer **lucide**.

# Game Mode Rules

## Single Player

- Allow unlimited plays (unlike official Wordle).
- A new word is generated after each successful or failed attempt.
- Show keyboard feedback for correct/incorrect letters.

## Two Player

1. Two player modes allow competition to guess the word first.
2. Each player is assigned a unique `roomId`.
3. Players can:
   - Share their `roomId` for others to join.
   - Input another user’s `roomId` to join their game.
4. Each room supports **a maximum of 2 players**.
5. Game starts when both players are connected.
6. Backend will use WebSocket to sync guesses and declare the winner in real time.
